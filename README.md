A simple CPU benchmarking script written in Python.

I didn't write this to be anything serious or as a legitimate benchmarking utility.

So don't expect Cinebench, this is a Python script I wrote over the course of a couple hours.

Just wrote this for a bit of Python practice, but hopefully this could be of use as a simple, lightweight benchmarking script.

To run it, open a terminal in the folder the script is saved in, and enter the command:
"python primes.py"

This script will also ask if you'd like to write out a logfile at the end.
Said logfile includes information such as:

	-When the script was ran
	-What mode the script was ran in
	-How many prime numbers were found
	-How long it took to find all requested primes
	-A dump of which prime numbers were found

The logfile will be saved in the same folder as the script and will be named "log.txt"

Thanks for checking out my code!
