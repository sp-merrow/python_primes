A simple CPU benchmarking script written in Python.

I didn't write this to be anything serious or as a legitimate benchmarking utility.
So don't expect Cinebench, this is a Python script I wrote over the course of a couple hours.
Just wrote this for a bit of Python practice, but hopefully this could be of use as a simple, lightweight benchmarking script.

To run it, open a terminal in the folder the script is saved in, and enter the command:
"python primes.py"

Thanks for checking out my code!
